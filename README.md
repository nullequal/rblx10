# rblx11
 a 2011 Roblox client (August 22 / version-b0b74ccbad4f4893)

# usage
- to play solo execute solo.lua
- to start hosting a server use host.lua
- to join that server use join.lua


# KNOWN ISSUES
- duplication of game content upon joining a networkserver
- for some reason faces stretch in an online game
- many important functions need to be patched

# notes
- be aware of that when hosting a server online globally you are prone to doxxing as joiners require the serverid (which is basically an ip address) to join, using a VPN is recommended. 
- trustcheck is fully patched, meaning people can use any image from any website including porn and gore sites. this will be reverted soon.
