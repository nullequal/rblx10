a 2011 Roblox client (August 22)


to play solo execute solo.lua
to start hosting a server use host.lua
to join that server use join.lua


KNOWN ISSUES:
        duplication of game content upon joining a networkserver
        for some reason faces stretch in an online game
        many important functions need to be patched


be aware of that when hosting a server online globally you are prone to doxxing as joiners require the serverid (which is basically an ip address) to join, using a VPN is recommended.
also trustcheck is fully patched, meaning people can use any image from any website including porn and gore sites. this will be reverted soon.
